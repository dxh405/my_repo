<title>Neighbor</title>

<body>
<mainOne>
Down home
he sets on a stoop
and watches the sun go by.
In Harlem 
when his work is done
he sets in a bar with a beer
He looks taller then he is
and younger than he ain't.
He looks darker than he is, too.
And he is smarter than he looks,
</mainOne>

<italisized>
He ain't smart.
That cat's a fool.
</italisized>

<mainTwo>
Naw, he ain't neither.
He's a good man, 
except that he talks too  much.
In fact, he's a great cat. 
But when he drinks, 
he drinks fast.
</mainTwo>

<italisized>
Sometimes
he don't drink.
</italisized>

<closing>True,
he just
let his glass
set there. </closing>
